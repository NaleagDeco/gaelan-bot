I am Attempting to Replace Myself with a Small Ruby Script
==========================================================

[@mispy](https://mispy.me/) has created this wonderful twitter bot framework called [twitter_ebooks](https://github.com/mispy/twitter_ebooks).

Through the magic of something something _markov chain_ something something, I can take the history of my organic tweets and feed them into something that will produce them in an uncanny-valley kind of way.

I'd highly recommend reading twitter_ebook's instructions to figure out how to run this. You will need to set twitter API credentials using the following N variables

  * TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY
  * TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET
  * TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN
  * TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET

This codebase is optimized to run via Docker, which mostly means that I haven't thought very hard about running it in any way except the way I am.
  
I hope you enjoy this! Hopefully I will have the chance to grow it into a monstrosity that will consume us all in time!
